------------------------------About------------------------------
Java File Sync is a simple directory tree synchronization program
written in java.  Jfs is currently a command line only program
and is can be ran anywhere.  It requires a sever to host the sync
directories.  You can easily sync any directory with any machine
on any network.  Jfs uses sockets to communicate back and forth
and is fairly efficient.

---------------------------How to Use----------------------------
Usage is extremely simple, below are examples of both client and
server arguments.  A pre-compiled .jar file is found in the
executables directory.

---Server
The server is a vital part of Jfs as it is what hosts the syncing
directories.  You will need to run Jfs server as:

   java -jar jfs.jar -s

The Jfs server will run until you choose to close it by CTL + C

---Client
The client is the machine you currently would like to sync any
given directory with the server.  
You will need to run Jfs client as:

   java -jar jfs.jar -c Server.IP DirectoryToSync
      ex: java -jar jfs.jar -c 192.168.1.100 ~/working/

The Jfs client will connect to the given server and close when
syncing is finished.

To list the directories that the server hosts use:
   java -jar jfs.jar -c Server.IP -ls
      ex: java -jar jfs.jar -c 192.168.1.100 -ls

You then can create a hosted directory and sync it with the
server by executing the command above.

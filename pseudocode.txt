Client connects to running server

Server stores the directory in its PWD
Client passes in directory to sync + serverIP

Client sends dirName + modifiedTime
Server sends Exists or not
If file exists on server && server modified last
   update client file
else
   update server file
move to next file

Server sends dirName
Client sends exists or not
if does not exist
   ask if would like to delete servers copy
   if yes
     delete server copy
   if no
     send server copy to client
   if noALL
     set noAll flag and always take servers copy
   else {default}
     do nothing
move to next file
end



2 way talking:

CLIENT: dirName
Server: exists = TRUE or FALSE
   
if directory
   CLIENT: VECTOR<STRING> = dirName, PATH
   SERVER: true
else
   CLIENT: VECTOR<STRING> = fileName, PATH, lastModified
   SERVER: TRUE or FALSE (update?)
   if TRUE
      CLIENT: SEND FILE
      SERVER: TRUE
   else if FALSE
      CLIENT: TRUE
      SERVER: SEND FILE
      CLIENT: TRUE
      SERVER: SEND LAST MODIFIED
